# Approach B: WordPress on D1

WordPress runs as PHP compiled to WebAssembly in a Worker. Its database is D1. There is no MySQL and no server.

Status: WordPress installs and runs on D1 in local workerd (spike B2). Nothing is deployed. Findings below are from 2026-11-03.

## The parts

| Part | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | `@php-wasm/web-8-3` 3.1.62, JSPI build (GPL-2.0-or-later) | Open source. It has `pdo_sqlite`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `zlib` and `libxml`. It has an `instantiateWasm` hook, so the Worker can pass a bundled module. The HostlessWP engine is binary only, so we cannot build on it. |
| MySQL to SQLite | `sqlite-database-integration` (`WP_SQLite_Driver`) | WordPress sends MySQL. This driver parses it and writes SQLite. |
| Database | D1 binding | The goal of approach B. |
| Files | WordPress core, theme and plugins bundled; uploads in R2 | Same as HostlessWP. |

## Findings

### 1. PHP can wait for D1. Measured.

D1 is async. PHP runs synchronously. JSPI lets WebAssembly pause on a JavaScript promise.

Local workerd (Wrangler 4.157.0, compatibility date 2026-07-01) returned:

```
{"Suspending":"function","promising":"function","Tag":"function"}
```

So `WebAssembly.Suspending` and `WebAssembly.promising` exist. Not yet checked on the deployed runtime.

### 2. The PHP engine fits.

The JSPI `php_8_3.wasm` is 18,065,768 bytes, and 6,975,027 bytes after `gzip -9`. The Worker size limit is 64 MiB on both plans. Memory is 128 MB per isolate, so WordPress plus PHP must fit in that. Not yet measured.

### 3. The driver uses a small part of PDO.

`WP_SQLite_Connection` accepts a `PDO` instance in `$options['pdo']`. The driver and its information schema classes call only these: `prepare`, `execute`, `query`, `fetchAll`, `fetchColumn`, `columnCount`, `rowCount`, `lastInsertId`, `quote`, `setAttribute`.

Plan: a `D1_PDO` class that extends `PDO` and sends each statement to the D1 binding through JSPI. Counted with `grep` on `sqlite-database-integration` at `f05c1f9`.

### 4. Blocker: the driver needs PHP functions inside SQLite.

The driver registers 43 PHP functions in SQLite with `PDO::createFunction` (`class-wp-sqlite-pdo-user-defined-functions.php`). The SQL it writes calls them. Examples: `year`, `month`, `unix_timestamp`, `now`, `rand`, `md5`, `regexp`, `field`, `from_unixtime`, `get_lock`.

D1 cannot run a PHP function. A query that uses one fails on D1.

Fix: a D1 dialect in the translator. Each function becomes plain SQLite where it can:

| Function | SQLite form |
| --- | --- |
| `year(x)` | `CAST(strftime('%Y', x) AS INTEGER)` |
| `month(x)` | `CAST(strftime('%m', x) AS INTEGER)` |
| `now()` | `datetime('now')` |
| `unix_timestamp(x)` | `CAST(strftime('%s', x) AS INTEGER)` |
| `rand()` | `(random() / 18446744073709551616.0 + 0.5)` |
| `field(x, a, b)` | `CASE x WHEN a THEN 1 WHEN b THEN 2 ELSE 0 END` |
| `get_lock`, `release_lock` | Answer `1` without a query. One request runs at a time per isolate. |
| `md5`, `regexp` | No SQLite built-in. Compute in PHP when an argument is a constant. Otherwise fail with a clear error and list it in the compatibility table. |

The same work is needed for a Durable Object's SQLite, so it is not wasted if we add that backend.

### 5. Every query is a round trip. Not yet measured.

Each MySQL query from WordPress becomes one or more SQLite statements. Each statement is one call to D1. An uncached page can make 30 to 100 calls.

- Run the Worker next to the database (placement hint or Smart Placement). Measure the cost of one call.
- Send read-only statements in a `batch()` where the driver allows it.

### 6. The Free plan's limit is CPU, not D1 queries. Measured locally.

Local results (spike B2, `docs/results.md`):

- Logged-out pages make 11 to 37 D1 calls. The Free limit is 50 per invocation ([D1 limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/limits/)), so these pages fit.
- The admin dashboard makes 116 calls and the editor 123. These need Paid (1,000).
- PHP takes 444 to 1,033 ms per page. D1 is 18 to 94 ms of that. The Free CPU limit is 10 ms per request ([Workers limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/)).

So on Free, logged-out pages must come from a page cache. Admin and post saves need Paid. Local time is wall time, not billed CPU time. A deploy must measure CPU time.

### 7. What D1 refuses, found by running WordPress

| D1 refuses | Spike B2 answer |
| --- | --- |
| `sqlite_version()` | Fixed answer `3.45.0`. |
| Pragmas on its own `_cf_*` tables | Hidden from schema reads. |
| Unknown pragmas (the driver's empty-result trick) | Answered locally. |
| `BEGIN`, `SAVEPOINT` and friends | Not sent. No rollback. |

The plugin's installer also opens its own database connection. The build patches it to use the D1 one.

## Prior work

- [sqlite-database-integration#288](https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/issues/288): D1 through the REST API. Open. A fork tried it in [Avunu/sqlite-database-integration#2](https://github.com/Avunu/sqlite-database-integration/pull/2), which was closed without a merge. Its branch is gone.
- [bhubbard/wp-cloudflare-d1](https://github.com/bhubbard/wp-cloudflare-d1): a `wpdb` replacement that calls D1. Not on the SQLite driver.
- Both use the D1 REST API from outside a Worker. Approach B uses the D1 binding from inside one.

## Steps

1. Boot `@php-wasm` in local workerd and run `phpinfo()`. Record memory and cold start.
2. `D1_PDO`: run `SELECT 1` from PHP against a local D1 through JSPI.
3. Install WordPress on D1 with the driver. Record every query that fails. That list is the D1 dialect work.
4. Add the D1 dialect for the functions in finding 4.
5. Page cache in KV or the Cache API for logged-out pages.
6. Deploy to a Free account and a Paid account. Fill row B in the README with **measured** results.
